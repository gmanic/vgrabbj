You wanna know the whole story? OK, here it is... For information on the prog,
(install and so on) just read on...


THE STORY
=========

I Goofed around with my new and nice Philips Vesta Pro (680K) for a week or
so. Nothing worked. Except camstream 0.16a (yes, the old version... the new
one gave me compile errors all the time) without snapshots etc.
[http://www.smcc.demon.nl/camstream/index.html]

Then, I found vgrabber.c, made by Phil Blundell in 1998... It was easy to
find, if you know what to take... (yes, I was at [www.linux-usb.org] before)
[http://www.tazenda.demon.co.uk/phil/v4l.html].

Worked fine with ppm's and a script solution around it to convert it to a
.gif and publish it via [http://gecius.de].

But that's the first problem with vgrabber: it supports .ppm only. And
because I didn't want to search for a ppm to jpeg tool and .gif ain't no
right for a webcam I decided to start a project on my own.

Despite all this: 256 colors for a webcam just look nasty :-).

I took a closer look on the w3cam.cgi source and found pretty simple code
for the jpeg transition. I grabbed this one, too.
[http://www.hdk-berlin.de/~rasca/w3cam/]

After several segmentation faults (as I already mentione, I'm not a
programmer!), I finally got it working.

It does -at the moment of writing this- exactly what I want. Grabb an image
from the cam, convert to jpeg and put it directly into the appropriate
web-directory.

I plan to implement a bit more. But I won't release these plans because that
could put some pressure on me. And that's another thing I don't need now...

So, that's the story so far. Here you go for the installation :-).


INSTALLATION
============

Well, this is an easy one. No configure, no nothing except a Makefile.

One little thing about the freetype: if you have a newer implementation,
please change the include file from freetype.h to freetype/freetype.h
Thanks to Ari Pollak.

You have exactly one option to compile this thing:

%make

If you want to copy the binary to /usr/local/bin do an additional

%make install

That's it. Just call the prog and get the information about the params.

%vgrabbj -h                // for help
%vgrabbj -s /dev/video     // for information about the device /dev/video


And remember: output is at stdout, so it could mess up your term...

One final note: if the prog starts to mess around, try set DEBUG=1 in the
Makefile and recompile. Then you get a better idea how far the prog works.

CREDITS
=======

Thanks to all the people being helpful and patient with this program.

A couple of people I'd like to mention:

First of all, my wife for being patient with me while coding.
Phil Blundell for the code of vgrabber.c.
Nemosoft, for the device-driver for the Philips USB Cam.
All the USB people for the USB code for linux.
rasca for the vidcat.c and font.c provided in the archive of w3cam.
      Thanks for the inspiration :-)
And finally, Philips for the webcam.

I'm not affiliated or anything else with Philips. I just like this cam.
