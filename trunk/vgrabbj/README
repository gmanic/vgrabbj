You wanna know the whole story? OK, here it is... For information on the prog,
(install and so on) just read on...


THE STORY
=========

I Goofed around with my new and nice Philips Vesta Pro (680K) for a week or
so. Nothing worked. Except camstream 0.16a (yes, the old version... the new
one gave me compile errors all the time) without snapshots etc.
[http://www.smcc.demon.nl/camstream/index.html]

Then, I found vgrabber.c, made by Phil Blundell in 1998... It was easy to
find, if you know what to take... (yes, I was at [www.linux-usb.org] before)
[http://www.tazenda.demon.co.uk/phil/v4l.html].

Worked fine with ppm's and a script solution around it to convert it to a
.gif and publish it via [http://gecius.de].

But that's the first problem with vgrabber: it supports .ppm only. And
because I didn't want to search for a ppm to jpeg tool and .gif ain't no
right for a webcam I decided to start a project on my own.

Despite all this: 256 colors for a webcam just look nasty :-).

I took a closer look on the w3cam.cgi source and found pretty simple code
for the jpeg transition. I grabbed this one, too.
[http://www.hdk-berlin.de/~rasca/w3cam/]

After several segmentation faults (as I already mentione, I'm not a
programmer!), I finally got it working.

It does -at the moment of writing this- exactly what I want. Grabb an image
from the cam, convert to jpeg and put it directly into the appropriate
web-directory.

I plan to implement a bit more. But I won't release these plans because that
could put some pressure on me. And that's another thing I don't need now...

So, that's the story so far. Here you go for the installation :-).


INSTALLATION
============

Well, this is should be a no-brainer.

%./configure

This will find out if you have all required libs etc. In case you don't
have the freetype lib, it'll just disable the timestamp functionallity.

Of course, there are more options to configure, read the INSTALL file.

%make

If you want to copy the binary to /usr/local/bin do an additional

%make install

That's it. Just call the prog and get the information about the params.

%vgrabbj -h                // for help
%vgrabbj -s /dev/video     // for information about the device /dev/video

A couple notes on the...


USAGE
=====

During startup every commandline-option is checked. If any one of them
fails (e.g. font-file not available), vgrabbj exits immediately, not
taking any picture! 

vgrabbj defaults to certain values, you can find them in the file
vgrabbj.h.

Especially the output defaults to <stdout>! If you call vgrabbj without
piping the output to a file or using the commandline-option, it WILL 
mess up your terminal. To get it back in a useful state, start any
program using ncurses (e.g. mc). After you exit that it'll look like
you want it.

If you don't like the defaults, there's a commandline option for almost
everything, see vgrabbj -h for details.

If you get odd colors (e.g. blue and red switched), that means you have
to use the -S switch the red and blue colors.

In case you use a IBM USB Cam, or any other cam which doesn't let you
set the resolution of the image after you load the driver, please make
sure you have the desired resolution set up at driver load time and
start vgrabbj with the parameter -w. This prevents vgrabbj to set the
image size.

vgrabbj takes a lot palettes, but certainly not everyone. The following
palettes are supported:

RGB24, RGB32, YUYV, YUV420, and YUY420P.

Remember, if you use the timestamp-string on the command line, ALWAYS
quote it with "! Otherwise, the options may get messed up. If you don't
know anything about how to put together a timestamp-string, take a look
at man strftime. All options are described in detail.

In daemon mode, it is NOT useful to use -D 7 (log little step), because
it would really fill you syslog *fast*! Use the default or even less.

In case something goes wrong in daemon mode (e.g. video-device not
accessible), vgrabbj will retry for a while (approx. 1h). This is to
accomodate other applications you might run while vgrabbj tries to get
an image. After that time, it'll exit! In case e.g. the font-file gets
lost, vgrabbj will mention this in the logfile, but continue just
without the timestamp. As soon as you reinstate the font-file, it'll
work as desired :-).

vgrabbj reacts to a `kill <pid>` that it finishes the current image, if
any, cleans up, and exits. If it takes a moment, this may be because it
is sleeping (in daemon mode).

If you need any further instructions, please re-read this README, see
the vgrabbj-helpscreen and doublecheck your commandline. If everything
fails, let me know. You'll find the email address somewhere in this
archive :-).

CREDITS
=======

Thanks to all the people being helpful and patient with this program.

A couple of people I'd like to mention:

First of all, my wife for being patient with me while coding.
Phil Blundell	for the code of vgrabber.c.
Nemosoft	for the device-driver for the Philips USB Cam and the
          	conversion routines for different palettes.
Robert Wessels	for some good ideas and code.
All USB people	for the USB code for linux.
rasca		for the vidcat.c and font.c provided in the archive of
		w3cam. Thanks for the inspiration :-)

And finally, Philips for the webcam - even though I had to pay for it :-)

I'm not affiliated or anything else with Philips. I just like this cam.
